# ABCDNeuralNetwork

In this project, I developed the ABCDNetwork class for my ATCS: Honors Neural Networks course during my senior year of high school. This program models a three-layer A-B-C-D network with a configurable number of input, hidden, and output nodes. The program is trained to recognize the number of fingers being held up in front of a blank whiteboard. 

Program can be run in terminal using ABCDBackprop as the configuration.

If using Mac:
- enter 'java ABCDBackprop' to run default network.
- enter 'java ABCDBackprop network' to train on provided images (1-25)
- enter 'java ABCDBackprop network2' to test on provided images (26-30)
